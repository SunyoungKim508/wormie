Trusty CD-rom

## Heading ##
  > WORMIE

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Empowering consumers to view the world though someone elses eyes with view driven content.

## Summary ##
  > A location based video platform, where the content is determined by users before it's created.

## Problem ##
  > Much of the content available today is determined by the person creating the video. Users are at the mercy of the recorder, which is especially true for location based video content like periscope.

## Solution ##
  > Wormie looks to allow users to determine the content that they would like to view before it's even created. Requests can be made for content capturing an event or location that you are not able to view yourself. These requests can be created anywhere in the world at a specific location, or a path between multiple locations.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Thanks to WORMIE I can see things around the world while in the comfort of my own home."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Head to the Apple App store, and search keyword 'wormie' to download the app.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I was moving to a new city, but could not view an open house in person. I was able to enlist the help of a fellow WORMIE, and get a virtual viewing of the place!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Want to see how the crowd is at a local free concert before heading out, or already out at an event and want to help a fellow wormie findout for themselves? Jump through the wormhole, and get on WORMIE today!
